Sea Ice Concentration retrieval from AVHRR Global Area Coverage measurements.

This is implementation of the subtask D1.6.1 of the [ICE-ARC](www.ice-arc.eu) project: "Estimating uncertainty of the sea ice concentration retrieval in the Arctic during the summer melt season. The aim of the project is to compare and analyse sea ice concentration values derived from the Passive Microwave imagers with sea ice concentration retrievals based on optical measurements.
